## Tasks from the Machine Learning with Python course in freeCodeCamp

### 1. Rock paper scissors with Q learning:

For this challenge, I have created a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. A program that picks at random will usually win 33% of the time. To pass this challenge my program must play matches against four different bots with different strategies, winning at least 33% of the games in each match. I have beaten the bots by implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm which is called Q-learning.

### 2. Cat and Dog Image Classifier:

For this challenge, I have completed the code to classify images of dogs and cats. I have used Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time. My validation accuracy was 68.10%. 

### 3. Book Recommendation Engine using KNN:

In this challenge, I have created a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors. The dataset I have used is called Book-Crossings dataset. This dataset contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.

### 4. Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator:

In this challenge, I have predicted healthcare costs using a regression algorithm. I have been given a dataset that contains information about different people including their healthcare costs. The data is to predict healthcare costs based on new data. To pass the challenge, model.evaluate must return a Mean Absolute Error of under 3500. My mean absolute error was 3194.1250.

### 5. Neural Network SMS Text Classifier:

In this challenge, I have to created a machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam". A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.
